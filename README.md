# Welcome

**Macroeconomcis with [Python](https://www.python.org/)** serves as an intro and intermediate tutorial of how to apply Pyhton to typical topics covered in an Intermedite Macroeconomcis course. The notes included in this site assume familiarity with macroeconomic models and an introductory knowledge of Python.

These notes do not provide a full discussion of macroeconomc models nor intend to show the **best practices** of coding in Python. The intention of these notes is to get us started with **how** to use Python in macroeconomics. The website [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) offers more advanced and detailed documentation.

The material is written as [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and rendered in Jupyter's [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

---
> Macroeconomics with Python is project in development. More material will be uploaded as it becomes available.
