# Welcome

**Macroeconomcis with [Python](https://www.python.org/)** serves as an intro and intermediate tutorial of how to apply [Python](https://www.python.org/) to typical topics covered in an Intermedite Macroeconomcis course. The notes included in this site assume familiarity with macroeconomic models and an introductory knowledge of Python.

These notes do not provide a full discussion of macroeconomc models nor intend to show the coding **best practices**. The intention of these notes is to get us started with **how** to use Python in macroeconomics. The website [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) offers more advanced and detailed documentation.

The material is written as [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and rendered in Jupyter's [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

> Macroeconomics with Python is project in development. More material will be uploaded as it becomes available.
