## Where to get Python?

Probably the most user-friendly to get Python is through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), an environement that allows to easily download and update Python packages and extensions.

[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) also comes with [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) and other applications.

In addition to its applicatoins, [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) also includes instructional videos and documents.

## Where to write Python code?

You can use a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook. But, it is useful to have an "IDE." Anaconda also comes with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for Python as well as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you are familiar with R, Anaconda also comes with RStudio.
