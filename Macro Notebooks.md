# Macro Notebooks

## What is Jupyter Notebook
[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook is a web-based interactive development environment for code, and data. [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) is a convenient tool to share and collaborate in scientific projects. A useufl feature of [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks is that it allows to creat documents that contain live code, equations, visualization along a narrative text (in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)).

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are divided in **cells**, where each cell has its own fromat (ie. Markdown, code, or plan text). Each notebook can also be exported in different formats (.pdf, html, etc.)

Each [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks offers a discussion of an economic model and sample codes that hows how to calculate or plot feates of the chosen model. 

Models may have more than one cell with [Python](https://www.python.org/) codes. Since the purpose of these notebooks is educational, each cell is written in a way that can be executed indendently of previous code-cells. For instance, the code presented in a cell can be copied into an IDE (ie. [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)) and execute it independently of other code-cells in the notebook.
